# Malaria-Prediction-in-North-India

## Objective:
To make predictions of plasmodium virus cases in North India (Chandigarh) with the use of Linear Regression , Support Vector Machine and Auto-Arima algorithms. The accuracy of prediction is measured by calculating the Explained Variance Score,  Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error metrics.
The aim is to get better prediction results compared to the individual algorithms by combining the results of these individual models.  

## Methods:
The proposed work determines the accuracy of Linear Regression , Support Vector Machine and Auto Arima models and ensembles them together to find the trend of prediction using Simple average as well as Weighted average ensembling techniques.

## Results: 
A comparison of performance among the three models indicated that the ARIMA model performed the best and had small RMSE And MAE values. But by introducing the technique of Ensemble Modelling using Weighted Average and combining the prediction of the three individual algorithms by assigning suitable weights resulted in much lower RMSE and MAE values.
